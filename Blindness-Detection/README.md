# Blindness Detection using ResNets with PyTorch

* The dataset for this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/aptos2019-blindness-detection).
* Got a training loss of **0.6524** and a validation loss of **0.6809** on 3662 samples of training images and 1928 samples of testing images.
* The accuracy score of this model on test score is not so good because here I used ResNet152, but we can improve this accuracy score with the help of EfficientNet and other CNNs architecture.
* These models may be used to detect other sorts of diseases in the future, like glaucoma and macular degeneration.
