# Blindness Detection using ResNets with PyTorch

* The dataset for this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/aptos2019-blindness-detection)
* The accuracy score of this model on test score is not so good because here I used ResNet152, but we can improve this accuracy score with the help of EfficientNet and other CNNs architecture.
